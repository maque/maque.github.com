I've remember when I was young, reading about Demoscene. Something inside of me pushed me to write first mail to first contact.
Back then it wasn't *contact* it was *ctx". My first mail was ugly, some random stuff and toughts, I think I've send about 3 mails,
each was floppy disk.

Time passed. I even forgot I've send anything.
And then...First mail arrived, floppy inside, lot of falyers, funny smell. First names came up like Scorpik or Lazur, first Zins
from demoscene. Finally I was "swapping" disks with about 20 ctx, I was going on parties like Xenium'99 and enjoyed this brand
new world. I've meet a lot of friends, I went deep into demoscene and lost myself there.

Yet somehow I wasn't prepared for that. I was thinking about programming, I was reading coding stuff & assembler stuf... I don't know,
maybe I was just stupid. I couldn't get into things like offsets in assembler, tunel effects and other stuff were mystery for me.

Now this misterry reveals itself, but verry slow. I feel stupid again, yet I have more determination to acctually understand all of this
stuff. It's my great challenge and I will do it.

But I want to do it on my own, I want to understand and grasp each line of code. I don't want just copy & paste, hope that it will work.
I wan't to be surre of each pixel...
So I'm still struggling with Bump Mapping, yet I can promise, that if this fight continues, I will provide maybe something more easier for me.
Plasma of Fire effect are goint to be next.
Stay tuned.
