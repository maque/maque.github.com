There was a while when I last wrote anything for blog. Dajsiepoznac intiative by Maciej Aniserowicz is a good kick to back to this habbit.
There was a dream I has when I was younger - it was dream about being great coder like guys from Demoscene. Although I liked writing stories and poems,
although I was fascinated and mesmerized by music and graphic, those cool 3D effects were like magic for me. So lets try to go together through all Demoscene
coders effect.

{% highlight javascript %}
function DemosceneChallenge(){
	console.log("Begin!");	
}
{% endhighlight %}
