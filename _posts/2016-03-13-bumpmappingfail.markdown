So I was trying to do Old School pixel bump mapping and failed misserably. At first I was thinking that should be quite easy task, after all I have some code examples and resources.

Unfortunatelly I believe I didn't took eneough time to really understand how normals and vectors are working in 2D bump mapping.

Also I think I should go a little bit different approach in my journey into demoscene effects. Making more "demo" and less "effects" version of presentation. Maybe music generation in background isn't good idea, but some kind of beginning, text and ending would be nice.

So this time again without code & example.

Instead let enjoy together great demo from 99'
