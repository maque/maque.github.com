One of simplest DemoScene effects is RotoZoom which consists of two parts - scaled texture & rotation. Rotation is the easiest part, just simple old school angle calculation for new x/y coordinates.
Texture is more tricky part. There are many ways for scaling image yet coders from demoscene quickly found a way to produce both texture and scaling it at the same time. Assuming you have generated grayscale colors from 0 to 255 if you do

{% highlight javascript %}
	x^y % 255
{% endhighlight %}

you will get nice checker board. When you apply division both to X and Y then obviously you will be scaling board up, and when you multiply in this equastion X and Y then you will be scalling down. Why? Well I will show you this in code:


{% highlight javascript %}
	var pixels = [0,255,0,255];
	for(var x=0;x<100;x++){
		draw(pixels[x%4]);
	}
{% endhighlight %}

This will produce you nice black/white line. Now lets divide x by 2 and round down - what will happen? For X=0,1 you will get 0, for 2,3 - one and so on which means you will draw twice first pixel, then twice second. By dividing position of pixel you actually you are scaling up texture!

And now, presentation:
{% include rotozoom.html %}
