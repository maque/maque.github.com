No matter what kind of bug tracker are you using having priorites doesn't give you much information, specially if you are developing web application.
Assume you are seeing something like this (which very common no matter how many times you are asking for details):

| Bug name | Assigned To | Noticed By | Priority
| Site is not working | Maque | Tester A | HIGH
| Login is not working | Maque | Tester A | Low
| Registration not displayed corectly | Maque | Tester A | Medium

Ok at first glance it seems quite good. After all you can check each of bugs starting with HIGH. But probably most of the time you will see a lot of HIGH priority bugs (because each of them for tester is important) some Low and few Medium.
